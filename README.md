# HDF-HEALTH Tools and Information Center

Announcement: I'm looking for Geo-tagged health data samples. (e.g., Apple Watch 6 & Galaxy Watch 3 Electrocardiography/heartbeat/breathing data with geo-location in polluted/smog region).

This is a central hub for exchanging solutions on health data management in HDF5.
